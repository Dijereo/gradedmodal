initialize formulae in node:
// already done

apply static rules to node:
expand conjunctions
stop if contradiction
save disjunctions
if disjunction is sat ignore
else if disjunction is resolved expand other branch
else if disjunction is contradiction stop
else rotate
until all rotated
fork one disjunction (maybe using ke rule?)
recurse
(implement backjumping?)
save open branches with modals
yield open branch with no modals
after yielded all modalless branches yield from branches with modals
stop when all branches yielded


sat graded:
apply static rules
iter over open branches
for each open branch
set up transition worlds tableaux
recurse check sat
set up ilp for stat transitions
return if found solution


ke:
keep track of formulae that are added just for contradiction but not split further
